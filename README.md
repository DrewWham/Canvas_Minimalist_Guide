## Communicating with Students with announcments

Announcements allow instructors to communicate with students about course activities and post interesting course-related topics. Announcements are designed to allow instructors to broadcast information out to all members of a course or to all members of sections within a course. Students may be able to reply to announcements, but replies are not considered to be a conversation and do not appear in the Conversations Inbox.

## Making assesments with Canvas quizzes

The quiz tool is used to create and administer online quizzes and surveys. You can also use quizzes to conduct and moderate exams and assessments, both graded and ungraded. The steps to create quiz content are the same for each quiz type.  You can create graded quizzes, practice quizzes, graded surveys, and ungraded surveys.

Graded quiz types display in the Syllabus, Gradebook, Calendar, and To Do Lists.
